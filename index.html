                Cuckoo for cucumbers? Smitten by squash? Partial to pumpkins? Mesmerized by melons? You're in the right place! The Gourd Gals is North America's #1 Cucurbitaceae fanclub. The organizers of the much celebrated annual Squash Convention & Jamboree and the inventors of pumpkin spice, The Gourd Gals has been a cultural force in North America for over 30 years. Our membership includes many distinguished gals including the governor general of Canada, Her Excellency The Right Honorable Mary Simon, famed talk show host and television producer Oprah Winfrey, and American novelist and playwright Cormac McCarthy (long-time gourd enthusiast and honorary gal).
